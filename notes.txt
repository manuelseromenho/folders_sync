# Structuring script

# 1) copy files and be sure exactly match content of the source folder
    # if files are still being created/edit, we need to "lock"(skip that file) <- not in initial version

    # create argument logic

    # if exists on TARGET AND SOURCE not, remove from TARGET
    # if exists on SOURCE and TARGET, compare sizes, compare update dates, compare hashes (SHA1)

# 2) synchronization should be performed in periods (in the argument have seconds, and sleep for that)

# 3) Log to file (created, copied, removed), console output

# 4) Path for log file, and sync interval in the arguments (timestamp or date time)
